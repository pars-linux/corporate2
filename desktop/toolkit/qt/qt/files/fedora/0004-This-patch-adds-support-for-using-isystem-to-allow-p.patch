Subject: [PATCH 04/13] This patch adds support for using -isystem to allow putting an include
 directory at the end of the compiler's header search path.

I don't have the exact output anymore (I've since patched Qt's configure) but
essentially, since I have pcre.h in /opt/kde4-deps/include, it was
conflicting with Qt's (modified) pcre.h in the WebKit bits, since
-I /opt/kde4-deps/include ends up in CXXFLAGS in the generated makefiles, it
comes *before* the specific locations in INCPATH on the compile line, and you
end up with a conflict with the system-installed pcre.h.

Presumably, if your pcre.h is in /usr/include as on most Linux systems, you
wouldn't notice this issue since /usr/include's already in your include path
and people likely don't pass -I /usr/include to configure.  I suspect that on
any platform with a regular, system-installed pcre.h (or clucene headers),
adding -I /usr/include would exhibit this bug, just as a custom-installed
pcre/clucene in another root would.
