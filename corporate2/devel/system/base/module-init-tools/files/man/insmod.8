.SH NAME
insmod \- simple program to insert a module into the Linux Kernel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBinsmod\fR [ \fB\fIfilename\fB\fR ]  [ \fB\fImodule options\fB\fR\fI...\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBinsmod\fR is a trivial program to insert a
module into the kernel: if the
\fIfilename\fR is a hyphen, the module is
taken from standard input. Most users will want to use
\fBmodprobe\fR(8) instead, which is
more clever.
.PP
Only the most general of error messages are reported: as the
work of trying to link the module is now done inside the kernel,
the \fBdmesg\fR usually gives more information
about errors.
