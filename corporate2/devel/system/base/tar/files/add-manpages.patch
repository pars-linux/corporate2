+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.LP
+This manual page documents the GNU version of
+.B tar
+, an archiving program designed to store and extract files from 
+an archive file known as a 
+.IR tarfile.
+A 
+.IR tarfile 
+may be made on a tape drive, however, it is also common
+to write a
+.IR tarfile
+to a normal file. 
+The first argument to 
+.B tar
+must be one of the options:
+.BR Acdrtux ,
+followed by any optional functions.
+The final arguments to 
+.B tar
+are the names of the files or directories which should be archived. The use
+of a directory name always implies that the subdirectories below should be
+included in the archive.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP
+.B tar \-xvvf foo.tar
+extract foo.tar
+.TP
+.B tar \-xvvzf foo.tar.gz

+.SH BUGS
+.LP
+The GNU folks, in general, abhor man pages, and create info documents instead.
+Unfortunately, the info document describing tar is licensed under the GFDL with
+invariant cover texts, which violates the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  As
+a result, the info documentation for tar is not included in the Debian package.
+
+If you want to read the complete documentation for GNU tar, please refer to
+the online version at <http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/index.html>.
+
+This man page was created for the Debian distribution.  It does not describe
+all of the functionality of tar, and it is often out of date.  Patches to 
+improve the coverage and/or accuracy of this man page are appreciated, and
+should be filed as wishlist severity bugs against the Debian tar package, 
+not submitted to the GNU tar maintainers.

+.Sh NAME
+.Nm rmt
+.Nd remote magtape protocol module
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm rmt
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm Rmt
+is a program used by tar, cpio, mt, and the remote dump and restore
+programs in manipulating a magnetic tape drive through an interprocess
+communication connection.
+.Nm Rmt
+is normally started up with an
+.Xr rexec 3
+or
+.Xr rcmd 3
+call or the
+.Xr rsh 1
+command.
+.Pp
+The 
+.Nm rmt
+program accepts requests specific to the manipulation of
+magnetic tapes, performs the commands, then responds with
+a status indication.  All responses are in
+.Tn ASCII
+and in
+one of two forms. 
+Successful commands have responses of:
+.Bd -filled -offset indent
+.Sm off
+.Sy A Ar number No \en
+.Sm on
+.Ed
+.Pp
+.Ar Number
+is an
+.Tn ASCII
+representation of a decimal number.
+Unsuccessful commands are responded to with:
+.Bd -filled -offset indent
+.Sm off
+.Xo Sy E Ar error-number
+.No \en Ar error-message
+.No \en
+.Xc
+.Sm on
+.Ed
+.Pp
+.Ar Error-number
+is one of the possible error
+numbers described in
+.Xr intro 2
+and
+.Ar error-message
+is the corresponding error string as printed
+from a call to
+.Xr perror 3 .
+The protocol is comprised of the
+following commands, which are sent as indicated - no spaces are supplied
+between the command and its arguments, or between its arguments, and
+.Ql \en
+indicates that a newline should be supplied:
+.Bl -tag -width Ds
+.Sm off
+.It Xo Sy \&O Ar device
+.No \en Ar mode No \en
+.Xc
+Open the specified 
+.Ar device
+using the indicated
+.Ar mode .
+.Ar Device
+is a full pathname and
+.Ar mode
+is an
+.Tn ASCII
+representation of a decimal
+number suitable for passing to
+.Xr open 2 .
+If a device had already been opened, it is
+closed before a new open is performed.
+.It Xo Sy C Ar device No \en
+.Xc
+Close the currently open device.  The
+.Ar device
+specified is ignored.
+.It Xo Sy L
+.Ar offset No \en
+.Ar whence No \en
+.Xc
+.Sm on
+Perform an
+.Xr lseek 2
+operation using the specified parameters.
+The response value is that returned from the
+.Xr lseek
+call.
+.Sm off
+.It Sy W Ar count No \en
+.Sm on
+Write data onto the open device.
+.Nm Rmt
+reads
+.Ar count
+bytes from the connection, aborting if
+a premature end-of-file is encountered.
+The response value is that returned from
+the
+.Xr write 2
+call.
+.Sm off
+.It Sy R Ar count No \en
+.Sm on
+Read
+.Ar count
+bytes of data from the open device.
+If
+.Ar count
+exceeds the size of the data buffer (10 kilobytes), it is
+truncated to the data buffer size.
+.Nm rmt
+then performs the requested 
+.Xr read 2
+and responds with 
+.Sm off
+.Sy A Ar count-read No \en
+.Sm on
+if the read was
+successful; otherwise an error in the
+standard format is returned.  If the read
+was successful, the data read is then sent.
+.Sm off
+.It Xo Sy I Ar operation
+.No \en Ar count No \en
+.Xc
+.Sm on
+Perform a
+.Dv MTIOCOP
+.Xr ioctl 2
+command using the specified parameters.
+The parameters are interpreted as the
+.Tn ASCII
+representations of the decimal values
+to place in the 
+.Ar mt_op
+and
+.Ar mt_count
+fields of the structure used in the
+.Xr ioctl
+call.  The return value is the
+.Ar count
+parameter when the operation is successful.
+.It Sy S
+Return the status of the open device, as
+obtained with a
+.Dv MTIOCGET
+.Xr ioctl
+call.  If the operation was successful,
+an ``ack'' is sent with the size of the
+status buffer, then the status buffer is
+sent (in binary).
+.El
+.Sm on
+.Pp
+Any other command causes 
+.Nm rmt
+to exit.
+.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
+All responses are of the form described above.

+.Xr mt 1 ,
+.Xr rsh 1 ,
+.Xr rcmd 3 ,
+.Xr rexec 3 ,
+.Xr mtio 4 ,
+.Xr rdump 8 ,
+.Xr rrestore 8
+.Sh BUGS
+People should be discouraged from using this for a remote
+file access protocol.
+.Sh HISTORY
+The
+.Nm
+command appeared in
+.Bx 4.2 .
