+This is a copy of Qt version 4.5.1.  It may include
+modifications which are necessary for KDE; these are listed in the
+patches directory.
+
+1. Qt-copy patches
+==================
+
+You may also consider running the apply_patches script before configuring qt-copy,
+which will apply all not yet applied patches from the patches/ directory that
+are considered safe (they mostly include optimizations and features that don't
+add new API). Note that most of those patches haven't been accepted
+by Qt Software yet. and therefore they'll make your qt-copy differ from official
+Qt version.
+
+2. Configuring Qt
+=================
+
+The recommended compile line is:
+
+--default-config-begin--
+./configure -qt-gif -debug -fast -no-exceptions -no-separate-debug-info \
+   -system-libpng -system-libjpeg -system-zlib \
+   -dbus -webkit -no-phonon -plugin-sql-mysql \
+   -nomake examples -nomake demos -prefix <installdir>
+--default-config-end--
+
+It contains "-debug", which greatly improves the use for backtraces (but
+also needs a lot more disk space and makes things slower). To build in
+release mode, replace it with "-release".
+
+It also contains "-no-separate-debug-info", which disables separate .debug
+files. Instead, the debug information will be built into the libraries.
+This option is needed when you install Qt.
+If you don't install Qt, it can be useful to disable this option,
+thus having separate debug symbol files. With separate debug files, you can
+just move those debug files to another directory to remove Qt debug symbols.
+Moving the files back will enable Qt debug symbols again.
+This is useful if you rarely need to step into Qt functions during debugging,
+because GDB loads much faster and uses less memory without Qt debug symbols.
+In the rare case you need to step into Qt code, you can temporarily enable
+debug symbols again by moving the debug files back. You can even load the Qt
+debug symbols from within GDB on demand, using the "symbol-file" command.
+
+It also contains the "-no-exceptions" argument, which disables C++
+exception support. Disabling exception support may improve memory
+consumption if GCC is being used. However, that also disables the
+QtXmlPatterns module since that requires exception support. If you
+plan on using that module, remove the option.
+
+If you are planning to compile Qt using an Icecream cluster you have to
+pass the option -no-pch (no precompiled headers) to configure to make
+distributed compilation work.
+
+3. Compiling Qt
+===============
+
+To compile Qt on a Unix platform, run:
+
+   export MAKEFLAGS=-j2
+   make
+   make install
+
+If your computer has more than one core or processor, you may consider
+increasing the "2" above. If you've got a compile farm available, you
+should adjust the -j argument to match the number of slots in that
+farm.
+
+4. Modifying & rebuilding Qt
+============================
+
+If you make modifications to the Qt source code, you don't need to
+build everything again. Simply go to the directory containing the
+Makefile closest to the files you changed and run "make" again.
+
+For example, if you modified src/corelib/io/qiodevice.cpp, do:
+
+   cd src/corelib
+   make
+
+Do not commit your modifications to qt-copy as such. If you have a fix
+that benefit others, see the "Creating Qt-copy patches" section below.
+
+5. Building Qt examples and demos
+=================================
+
+The "-nomake examples -nomake demos" arguments to the configure script
+mean that those two sections will not be configured for
+building. Which is unneeded for usage of the library.  If you want to
+compile the examples or demos later; just enter either directory and
+type:
+
+   qmake
+   make
+
+6. Building Qt documentation (only applies to Snapshot versions of Qt)
+============================
+
+To build and install the documentation, run:
+
+   make docs
+   ./config.status
+   make install
+
+It is necessary to do this once only, even if you rebuild Qt later.
+
+7. Using Qt uninstalled
+=======================
+
+To use without having to install it, configure it as follows:
+
+   ./configure <other configure options>  -prefix $PWD
+   make sub-src
+   make sub-tools
+
+Attention: DO NOT run
+
+   make install
+
+If you do, Qt will overwrite your include/ directory with its
+installation.
+
+8. Creating Qt-copy patches
+===========================
+
+If you have fixed a bug in Qt or modified it in any way that may
+benefit others, please share your change in the form of a patch. Do
+not commit your changes directly to the qt-copy module because they
+may be lost in a future update if they have not been added to the
+official Qt release.
+
+The exception to the above rule is that if the fix has been accepted
+by Qt Software (and so will appear in the next release of Qt), then
+it can be applied directly to qt-copy.  In this case, the patch
+should still be placed in patches/ as usual, but it should have a
+header line
+    Applied: yes
+
+Before creating a patch, it is recommended to contact Qt Software
+support via qt-bugs@trolltech.com and explain the situation. There may
+be a solution for the problem already or a new direction that should
+be accounted for.
+
+To create a patch, do the following:
+  a) make sure your Qt sources are clean of other changes. Run:
+     svn revert -R .
+  b) make your changes to the Qt source code and verify that it
+  compiles, links and works.
+  c) open the patches/README file and get the next patch number
+  (you must read and understand the README file; if you don't, ask for
+  help from other KDE developers)
+  d) create the patch with:
+     svn diff > patches/NNNN-short-description-of-your-patch.diff
+  where NNNN is the next available number.
+  e) open the file you've just created and add the header to it. The
+  header should be the template in patches/README followed by a longer
+  description of your patch.
+
+Don't forget to submit your patch to qt-bugs@trolltech.com along with
+the long description of the issue found, if you haven't already.
+Qt Software does not monitor the patches/ directory, so qt-copy
+patches do not get automatically applied to Qt official releases.
+
+When you receive the issue number and task tracker numbers, update the
+patch file.
+
+9. Known issues with current Qt code
+====================================
+
+In case you have strange issues with non-resizing windows and similar, use
+   export QT_USE_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1
+before starting KDE.
+
+10. Troubleshooting: Re-configuring and re-compiling
+===================================================
+
+For those updating the source in a directory where Qt has already
+been compiled, you may need to run the following commands from the
+top directory of your Qt sources:
+
+	find . -name '*.moc' | xargs rm
+
+Sometimes ./configure will refuse to run.  You may need to:
+	rm .qmake.cache
+
+If you think you may have run "make install" on an install-less Qt
+(srcdir == $QTDIR), run:
+
+	svn revert -R include
