# Config file for gpsd server

# ATTENTION: most of the configuration is done in the kernel device
# setup for USB/Serial, Garmin, or other, however, without hotplug,
# gpsd still needs to have the device set on the commandline.

# Set GPS_DEV to the device to be used by the gpsd server.
# This device must have the group tty and be writable (see
# the INSTALL file in the docs).

# This example is for a Deluo GPS Serial/USB converter dongle, really
# a pl2303 chip - CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_PL2303 in modern 2.6 kernels.
# The normal udev config provides the correct /dev/ttyUSB0 device.
# The second example is just a normal serial port...

# COM1 is equivalent to /dev/ttyS0
#GPS_DEV="/dev/ttyS0"

GPS_DEV="/dev/ttyUSB0"

# Use the following for gpsd with ntp instead of the older one below
GPSD_OPTS="-n"
